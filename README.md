# PaPiPuPePo ![icon](Visuals/PaPiPuPePoIcon.ico)

A very simple game that I built years ago when toying around with C++ game creation.
The code has been touched up a wee bit and some of the comments rephrased but the gameplay and base mechanics haven't changed.


As I built this years ago the code isn't 100% efficient/optimal.
If I were to start over I would definitely do a few things differently,
such as the bare-bones use of win32's stretchBlt function for the graphics or the way that the game clock works.
However I don't really want to waste more time on a old and simple game when I have other more interesting projects to work on.
The only reason I've pushed this to github is to help build up a portfolio :)

The game itself is named after the Japanese vowel sounds when combined with the consonant P,
no particular reason other than it sounds kind of funny (at least when I'm practicing hiragana aloud lol)

Pa ぱ, Pi ぴ, Pu ぷ, Pe ぺ, Po ぽ

## Gameplay

You play as the blue square and have to collect coins (cyan squares) without being caught by any of the bad guys (red squares).
For every coin you collect you score a point but a new bad guy spawns in making the game slightly harder!


### Controls

All movement is grid locked, (you move from square to square and can't rest between them)

W ⇒ move up

S ⇒ move down

A ⇒ move left

D ⇒ move right

The game ends when you are either caught by a red square or you close the window

## Important

### Game speed and rendering

The game speed and rendering is attached to a bare-bones timer system, see lines 146/147 of entry.cpp.
The game speed seems to run faster on higher performance machines, as such I've uploaded a version with a longer gameloop wait time.
(I'd rather the game was slower on weaker machines than too fast and flashy on stronger machines).

But I've included the Code::Blocks project so you can easily modify the line and recompile the project for your machine.
( hold > release + x, higher values of x make the game slower, lower values of x make the game faster).

If I were to do this project again I'd use something like glfw and use their timer system,
but again I don't want to waste anymore time on a game that was built years ago to test the waters of C++ game making.

### License

I'm releasing this project completely open source using the unlicense template: https://unlicense.org/

A grid locked square move around game isn't exactly a hard idea to come up with and implement,
so I don't see any point licensing the game with a stricter copyright/left license.

The unlicense website recommends adding some extra terms regarding major contributors and what not.
I'm not going to bother with anything like that for 2 reasons:

- Only I will be contributing to this specific repository

- It's a very basic game that anyone could come up with and create, I don't care if you make your own copy, recompile, modifiy, sell, etc. Just make sure you acknowledge the capialised part of the license file (see below)
